'''Castform''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ポワルン''' ''Powalen'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, it has the ability to [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Castform|change forms]] depending on the current [[weather]].
* During normal weather, {{weather|fog}}, a {{weather|sandstorm}}, or a {{weather|shadowy aura}}, it is in '''Normal''' form and is a {{t|Normal}} type.
* During {{weather|harsh sunlight}}, it is in '''Sunny Form''' and is a {{t|Fire}} type.
* During {{weather|rain}}, it is in '''Rainy Form''' and is a {{t|Water}} type.
* During {{weather|hail}}, it is in '''Snowy Form''' and is an {{t|Ice}} type.

==Biology==
Castform is an [[artificial Pokémon]] that changes appearance and attitude based on the weather. Its body is made of cells exactly like those of water molecules, causing its cellular structure to be chemically altered by temperature and humidity. Though not of its free will, it uses this ability to protect its tiny body. In its Normal Form, it resembles a plain, gray cloud with a single wisp extending from the top of its head. 

Under bright sunlight, it takes on its Sunny Form. Its lower half becomes pure white, while the head turns orange has develops small orange spheres around it. This gives it the overall appearance of the sun above a small cloud. Its skin glows and dries, and becomes hot to the touch. 

When soaked in rain, it takes on its Rain Form. It has a dark gray lower half resembling a storm cloud. The head turns blue and resembles a raindrop. Its body is soft and slippery, and seeps with water when compressed.

When hit by hail, it takes on its Snowy Form. Its head turns purplish-blue. The rest of the body changes into the shape of a mint green, {{wp|cumulonimbus cloud}}. Its body becomes a smooth ice-like material, partially frozen measuring temperatures near 23 degrees Fahrenheit.

Regardless of the form it takes, it will always have a large, spherical head and a lighter colored mask-like marking over its eyes. Aside from its various forms, Castform is able to utilize weather powers in the form of its previously [[signature move]], {{m|Weather Ball}}. Despite its manmade origins, it can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassland areas}}.

==Trivia==
* Castform is the only Pokémon in both the {{egg|Fairy}} and {{egg3|Amorphous}}s.
* Castform's Weather Ball will always receive {{STAB}} in any of its forms unless in a sandstorm, under Shadow Sky, or if it loses {{a|Forecast}}.
** Castform is the only Pokémon to receive this benefit from Weather Ball.
* In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, Castform has a body size of 4, despite it being a body size 1 in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|first Mystery Dungeon games]] and having the same in-game sprite in the second Mystery Dungeon games. This may have been changed to balance gameplay.
* Castform's weather-based transformations cannot be viewed in the forms section of the {{game2|Diamond|Pearl|Platinum}} Pokédex, nor do they appear on the field in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}.
** All of Castform's forms will appear in the forms section of the HeartGold and SoulSilver Pokédex upon obtaining one, even if it never transformed.
* Castform is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.
* Unlike most Pokémon with [[List of Pokémon with form differences|form differences]], Castform's alternate forms have no {{Shiny}} variations of their own, so only the Normal form of a Shiny Castform will look different.
* Before [[Generation VII]], Castform's Normal form was classified by Pokédex color sorting as white.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Castform}}
Castform resembles a living cloud and acts like weather in general, but it may also be based on a {{wp|weather balloon}}. It is similar in both concept and design to a ''{{wp|Teru teru bozu|teru teru bōzu}}'', a Japanese charm doll used to wish for good weather. Its forms and their types may have originated from the English saying "rain, hail, or shine." As Castform is said to be composed of molecules similar to water, its shape of a large sphere with two smaller orbs resembles an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule.

===Name origin===
Castform may be a combination of ''forecast'' (the prediction of weather) and ''transform'' or ''form'' (referring to its ability to change form depending on the weather). The German and French names reflect this.

Powalen may be a combination of ポワン ''powan'' (onomatopoeia of a sudden transformation, similar to "poof" in English) and 変わる ''kawaru'' (to change or transform).
